Demo weather-box component

# What's in here?

Here you find a simple example of a web component.

The component is called `<weather-box></weather-box>` and displays the weather for a given location, either in imperial or metric units.

It uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](openweathermap.org/api) to fetch data.
